            <p>
                As a WordPress/PHP developer, I built and maintained several public
                facing websites. The software was developed using PHP, JavaScript, jQuery,
                HTML and CSS. The e-commerce sites used Magento. Other sites used
                WordPress in a Pantheon environment. Source code was maintained in
                Subversion and Git repositories. I built and maintained a custom
                WebService proxy in PHP so the WordPress sites could generate leads in
                the Microsoft CRM server.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was a member of a software development team that develops and
                maintains an learning management system (LMS) (grades 3 through 12). The
                user interface is written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. The
                business tier is written in PHP with a custom-built MVC framework. It
                uses Doctrine as an object-relational mapper to interface with a MySQL
                back-end. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I also supported and developed a similar software product that uses
                Microsoft and open source technologies. For back-end operations, we use
                SQL Server 2005/2008 accessed through direct ODBC calls and through a
                Web Services interface. The business tier is developed in C# and VB.NET.
                The front end is chiefly comprised of HTML/CSS, jQuery and WinForms.
                Multimedia offerings, such as videos and games, are implemented in Flash
                and HTML5. Reports are implemented in Crystal Reports. We use Subversion
                and Git for source control.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working with the Curriculum Development department, I wrote scripts to
                automate the file management, validation, correction, reporting, source
                control management (Subversion), and deployment (server and CD) of a
                vast number of XML files. This is done using Bash, Python, Visual Basic
                and C#.
            </p>
            <p>
                My database administrative activities include creating and maintaining
                scripts written in Bash and Python to automate the code-generation of
                SQL scripts which perform the task of database schema migrations. I also
                maintain a GUI utility which allows tech-support and customers to easily
                perform database administrative tasks against production databases.
            </p>

            <section class="position-metadata">
              <time>2001 to 2008</time> <a href="https://www.revana.com">Direct Alliance Corporation</a> <span>Tempe, AZ</span>
            </section>
            <p>
              I was team-lead of a department which develops, maintains and optimizes
              a 3-tiered, internationalized, web-based, telesales ERP system for a
              large overseas client. It is a large system with multiple functional
              areas including order entry, fulfillment, accounting, account management
              and human resources. The system uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ASP and
              ASP.NET for its UI tier. Visual Basic COM DLL's and C# managed DLL's in
              a COM+ application are used as the business tier. Stored procedures
              running on a MS SQL Server database provided the data layer. Microsoft
              SQL Server replication is employed to maintain a separate database used for
              reports implemented with ActiveReports. The system also has a B2B
              ordering interface which accepts XML data (through HTTP POST's) for
              order placement. Fulfillment is accomplished by an EDI interface with
              suppliers. It fulfills 300-600 orders a day.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wrote a desktop application to automate the source control management
              (CVS and Subversion) and source code deployment of several web and
              text-based applications for several different clients. The software also
              maintains time metrics on SCM and QA personnel, maintains data related
              to the software changes being deployed, and reported on its data in text
              or Excel formats. The software was implemented in C# (WinForms). I wrote
              an ORM based on CSLA (Business Objects) to automated common CRUD tasks.
              I used a MySQL database for data persistence. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I maintained a Perl middleware program in a Linux environment
              responsible for file transfers (usually over FTP or SFTP) from servers
              in external networks to local servers and visa-versa. The files contain
              different type of high priority business data such as database extracts,
              TSR call data, EDI data and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wrote a Perl program to replicate Subversion commit deltas from one
              Subversion data store to another to provide a redundant repository in
              the case of a failure. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I wrote software to archive sales order records (along with child
              records from hundreds of child tables) to an archive database server.
              The software is composed of two programs: A C# WinForm application to
              configure the archiving process and a daemon program to archive the
              data.
            </p>
            <p>
              I maintained an internal website responsible for managing the
              communication between different departments and clients during major
              system failures such as a website outage. The system was written in
              ASP.NET and used Microsoft SQL Server as a back-ends. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I maintained a Forte3 (ERP) system written in IMS/BASIC in Linux and SCO
              UNIX environment for several different clients. The system provide many
              business functions such as: accounts receivable/payable, order entry,
              fulfillment and so on. The code is managed using a CVS repository.

              project included use of Microsoft Access interfacing with a MySQL
