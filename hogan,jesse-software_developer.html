              <p>
                  As a WordPress/PHP developer, I built and maintained several public
                  facing sites. The software was developed using PHP, JavaScript, jQuery,
                  HTML and CSS. The e-commerce sites used Magento. Other sites used
                  WordPress in a Pantheon environment. Source code was maintained in
                  Subversion and Git repositories. I built and maintained a custom
                  WebService proxy in PHP so the WordPress sites could generate leads in
                  the Microsoft CRM server.
              </p>
              <p>
                  I was a member of a software development team that develops and
                  maintains an learning management system (LMS) (grades 3 through 12). The
                  user interface is written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. The
                  business tier is written in PHP with a custom-built MVC framework. It
                  uses Doctrine as an object-relational mapper to interface with a MySQL
                  back-end. 
              </p>
              <p>
                  I also supported and developed a similar software product that uses
                  Microsoft and open source technologies. For back-end operations, we use
                  SQL Server 2005/2008 accessed through direct ODBC calls and through a
                  Web Services interface. The business tier is developed in C# and VB.NET.
                  The front end is chiefly comprised of HTML/CSS, jQuery and WinForms.
                  Multimedia offerings, such as videos and games, are implemented in Flash
                  and HTML5. Reports are implemented in Crystal Reports. We use Subversion
                  and Git for source control.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Working with the Curriculum Development department, I wrote scripts to
                  automate the file management, validation, correction, reporting, source
                  control management (Subversion), and deployment (server and CD) of a
                  vast number of XML files. This is done using Bash, Python, Visual Basic
                  and C#.
              </p>
              <p>
                  My database administrative activities include creating and maintaining
                  scripts written in Bash and Python to automate the code-generation of
                  SQL scripts which perform the task of database schema migrations. I also
                  maintain a GUI utility which allows tech-support and customers to easily
                  perform database administrative tasks against production databases.
              </p>

              <p>
                I was team-lead of a department which develops, maintains and optimizes
                a 3-tiered, internationalized, web-based, telesales ERP system for a
                large overseas client. It is a large system with multiple functional
                areas including order entry, fulfillment, accounting, account management
                and human resources. The system uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ASP and
                ASP.NET for its UI tier. Visual Basic COM  DLL's and C# managed DLL's in
                a COM+ application are used as the business tier. Stored procedures
                running on a MS SQL Server database provided the data layer. Microsoft
                SQL Server replication is used to maintain a separate database used for
                reports implemented with ActiveReports. The system also has a B2B
                ordering interface which accepts XML data (through HTTP POST's) for
                order placement. Fulfillment is accomplished by an EDI interface with
                suppliers. It fulfills 300-600 orders a day.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wrote a desktop application to automate the source control management
                (CVS and Subversion) and source code deployment of several web and
                text-based applications for several different clients. The software also
                maintains time metrics on SCM and QA personnel, maintains data related
                to the software changes being deployed, and reported on its data in text
                or Excel formats. The software was implemented in C# (WinForms). I wrote
                an ORM based on CSLA (Business Objects) to automated common CRUD tasks.
                I used a MySQL database for data persistence. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I maintained a Perl middleware program in a Linux environment
                responsible for file transfers (usually over FTP or SFTP) from servers
                in external networks to local servers and visa-versa. The files contain
                different type of high priority business data such as database extracts,
                TSR call data, EDI data and so on.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wrote a Perl program to replicate Subversion commit deltas from one
                Subversion data store to another to provide a redundant repository in
                the case of a failure. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I wrote software to archive sales order records (along with child
                records from hundreds of child tables) to an archive database server.
                The software is composed of two programs: A C# WinForm application to
                configure the archiving process and a daemon program to archive the
                data.
              </p>
              <p>
                I maintained an internal website responsible for managing the
                communication between different departments and clients during major
                system failures such as a website outage. The system was written in
                ASP.NET and used Microsoft SQL Server as a back-ends. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I maintained a Forte3 (ERP) system written in IMS/BASIC in Linux and SCO
                UNIX environment for several different clients. The system provide many
                business functions such as: accounts receivable/payable, order entry,
                fulfillment and so on. The code is managed using a CVS repository.
              </p>
